        <h2>Server side VS client side </h2>
         <p>when you hear the term server-side and client-side especially in the content of web development. client-side code is code on the user computer <span>-</span>when a web page is viewed, the page client-side code is downloaded then run and displayed by the browser. In the module we are explicit talking about client-side javascript</p>
         <p>Server-side code on the otherhand is runs on the server then it result are downloaded and display by the browser example of popular server-side web languages includes php, python, ruby, c# and even javascript. javascript can also by used as a server-side language for e.g in the popular node.js</p>

         <h3>Dynamic VS Static Code</h3>
         <p>The word <strong> dynamic </strong> is used to describe both <i> client-side javascript and server-side language</i> it refers to the ability to update the display the web page/app to show different things in the different circumstances generating new content as required. Server-side code dynamically generate new content on the server. for e.g pulling data from a database, whereas client-side javascript dynamiclly generate new content inside the browser on the client. e.g creating a new html table, filling it with data requested from the server, then displaying the tables in the webpage shown to the users. The meaning is slightly different in two contents but related and both approaches (server-side and client-side usually works together)</p>
         <br>
         <p>A web pages with no dynamically updateing content is refered to as <strong>static</strong> <span>-</span>it just shows the same content all the time </p>
